                        Dr. Dane Bozeman
                    </Text>
                    <Text fontSize="md">
                        Dr. Dane Bozeman is the founder of GradCapFinder. He
                        graduated with his doctorate in Curriculum and
                        Instruction from Texas A&M University in 2010. He
                        believes the world becomes a better place when people
                        care enough to achieve their doctorate. His professional
                        work experience includes 7 years as a Mathematics and
                        Science teacher in public and private secondary schools,
                        8 years as a university instructor for both
                        undergraduate and graduate level courses in Human
                        Cognition and Statistics, and over 10 years as a
                        researcher on Life, Physical, and Social science
                        projects.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Dane believes completed dissertations represent
                        both individual and community achievements. With a
                        background in all three sciences, he works with graduate
                        students to tailor individual learning experiences. In
                        doing so, Dane emphasizes four themes â€“ the learner,
                        knowledge, assessment, and community. By emphasizing
                        these four themes, Dane ensures the students he works
                        with make the most of their graduate school experience.
                        <br />
                        <br /> Dane, through GradCapFinder, has personally
                        worked with over 100 graduate students - from the US,
                        Asia, Europe, and the Middle East - in the past decade.
                        These students represent diverse academic fields;
                        including, Criminology, Education, Engineering, English
                        Literature, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology. Dane
                        has worked with these students to complete dissertations
                        and take leadership positions in the academy, industry,
                        and public policy arenas.
